## üîë Getting Telegram API Credentials

Before using TelegramBackup, you need to obtain your own Telegram API credentials:

1. **Visit the Telegram API Development Tools**:
   - Go to https://my.telegram.org
   - Log in with your Telegram account

2. **Create a New Application**:
   - Click on "API Development tools"
   - Fill out the form with your application details (you can use "TelegramBackup" for app title and short name)
   - Click "Create application"

3. **Get Your API Credentials**:
   - After creating the application, you'll see your **api_id** (a number) and **api_hash** (a string)
   - Keep these values secure - they're associated with your Telegram account

4. **Configure TelegramBackup**:
   - Open the `telegram_backup.py` file in a text editor
   - Locate these lines near the beginning of the file:
     ```python
     api_id = ********
     api_hash = ********************************
     ```
   - Replace them with your actual credentials:
     ```python
     api_id = 12345678  # Replace with your own api_id (numbers only, no quotes)
     api_hash = "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"  # Replace with your own api_hash (in quotes)
     ```
   - Save the file

> **IMPORTANT**: The `api_id` must be an integer without quotes, and the `api_hash` must be a string with quotes.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python telegram_backup.py
    ```

2. **First-Time Login**:
   - Enter your Telegram phone number when prompted (include country code, e.g., +12345678900)
   - You'll receive a code on your Telegram app - enter this code when prompted
   - If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to enter your password

3. **Managing Contacts and Entities**:
   - The script will automatically extract your contacts and save them to a CSV file
   - It will generate a list of all available entities (users, channels, groups) and save it to a CSV file
   - Review the entity list in your console to identify which ones you want to backup

4. **Backup Options**:
   Choose from the menu options:
   - **[E] Process a specific entity**: Backup a single chat, channel, or group
   - **[T] Process all entities**: Backup everything
   - **[U] Update existing backup**: Add only new messages to an existing backup
   - **[D] Delete Telegram service messages**: Clean up service messages
   - **[X] Close current session**: End the current session securely
   - **[S] Exit**: Exit the program

5. **When processing entities**:
   - You can specify how many messages to retrieve (leave blank for all)
   - Choose whether to download all media files (Y/N)
   - For large chats, consider processing in batches to avoid timeouts

6. **Updating existing backups**:
   - When using the [U] option, select the entity you want to update
   - The script will identify the last message in your existing backup
   - Only messages newer than this will be retrieved and added to the database
   - The HTML file will be regenerated with all messages (old and new)

7. **Accessing Your Backup**:
   - Messages are stored in an SQLite database (`.db` file)
   - An HTML file is generated for easy browsing of messages
   - Media files are saved in the `media/[entity_id]/` directory
   - The HTML interface shows messages grouped by date with sender information, reactions, replies, and media playback

## üì± HTML Export Features

The generated HTML export includes:

- **Message Grouping by Date**: Messages are organized by day for easier navigation
- **Sender Information**: Each message shows who sent it
- **Message Threading**: Replies are linked to original messages with preview on hover
- **Reactions Display**: See emoji reactions to messages
- **Media Playback**: Directly play audio, voice messages and videos in the browser
- **Image Display**: View images inline
- **Web Link Previews**: Link previews similar to Telegram's interface
- **Service Messages**: System notifications (joins, leaves, etc.) are properly displayed
- **Forwarded Messages**: Clear indication of forwarded content with source links when available
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive layout works on all devices

## üíæ Database Structure

The SQLite database contains the following main tables:

- **messages**: Stores the core message data including text, media, timestamps, and metadata
- **buttons**: Records message buttons and inline URLs
- **replies**: Tracks reply relationships between messages
- **reactions**: Stores emoji reactions to messages with counts

You can query this database directly using any SQLite browser for advanced analysis or custom exports.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Handling Large Backups

If you're backing up chats with hundreds of thousands of messages:

1. **Start with a smaller batch**: First try backing up a limited number (e.g., 1000) to test
2. **Ensure adequate storage**: Media files can consume significant disk space
3. **Use incremental updates**: After the initial backup, use the update feature for periodic updates
4. **Run in a stable environment**: Avoid using USB drives or removable storage for the backup process
5. **Be patient**: Large backups can take considerable time depending on your internet connection

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Syntax Error with API Credentials**:
   - Ensure `api_id` is an integer without quotes
   - Ensure `api_hash` is a string with quotes
   - Double-check that you saved the file after making changes

2. **Connection Errors**:
   - Verify your internet connection
   - Check if Telegram is accessible in your region
   - Some networks may block Telegram's API servers

3. **Permission Errors**:
   - Run the script from a location where you have read/write permissions
   - Avoid running from USB drives or network shares if possible

4. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - If you get import errors, verify that all required packages are installed
   - Try running `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

5. **Session File Issues**:
   - If you get errors related to the `.session` file, delete it and start a new session
   - These files are stored in the same directory as the script

6. **Unicode/Encoding Issues**:
   - If you see encoding problems in CSV files, make sure your terminal supports UTF-8
   - Try opening the CSV files in a modern spreadsheet application instead of a text editor

### Advanced Tips

- **Customizing HTML Output**: You can modify the `template.html` file to change how the exported HTML looks
- **Working with the Database**: The SQLite database can be opened with tools like DB Browser for SQLite if you want to perform custom queries
- **Automating Backups**: Consider setting up a scheduled task to run the script periodically
- **Media File Management**: Large media files are stored separately from the database in the `media/` directory, which you can back up independently

## üìù Technical Details

- **Message Processing**: TelegramBackup iterates through messages of a selected entity, extracts their content and metadata, and stores everything in an SQLite database.
- **Media Handling**: Media files are downloaded to a structured directory and referenced in the database by path and hash.
- **HTML Rendering**: Using Jinja2 templating, the script generates a responsive HTML interface for browsing the archived messages.
- **Flood Control**: The script implements flood control management by respecting Telegram API rate limits.
- **Character Encoding**: Special attention is paid to proper UTF-8 encoding to handle all languages and emoji correctly.
